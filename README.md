üîç Main Points of the Research:
The study, which was initiated as a combination of CNN - KNN architectures, consists of two parts: "Offline Phase" and "Online Phase".
Offline Phase: Data Preprocessing, Feature Extraction, Hyperparameters, Data Augmentation, Training CNN Model, Fine Tuning and Grid Search, Evaluation.
Online Phase: Preprocessing, Trained CNN Model (Feature Extraction), CNN - KNN Voting, Evaluation.

Data sets:
95% success was achieved with the results obtained by working on a total of 29,716 samples from the combination of FER2013, CK+, and KDEF data sets.

New Dataset Contribution:
I'm also excited to introduce our new dataset called ATS_FER2024! üåê
With this data set, model training was made from 48x48 pixel facial expressions of 183 different Turkish celebrities, and 89% success was achieved. Celebrities are included not only from today but also from #Ye≈üil√ßam.
According to our research, the data set is a first in #Turkey and has been left as a legacy to the industry. Development work is still continuing.
2nd version of the dataset powered by DPDA, a Data Augmentation method; ATS_FER2024_DPDA consists of 1102 PNGs.

üåê Online Stage and Real World Experience:
In addition to offline studies, real-world experiences and the performance of the algorithm in the online phase were evaluated on a total of 20 HR and IT employees in a private company, and 100% verification was achieved.

üî¨ Technology Used Methods:
Interactions of technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, CNN, KNN, Ensemble Systems, Deep Learning, PCA (Principal Component Analysis).
This dataset is a milestone that contributes to a closer understanding of Turkey's culture and facial expressions. Don't forget to visit article_link for your reviews and comments!
